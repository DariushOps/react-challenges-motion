## 🧠 How It Works

The Welcome Page features parallax scroll animations using useScroll and useTransform.

Navigation to the Challenges Page happens via React Router.

The Challenges Page uses Context API for managing challenge data and Framer Motion for entry/exit animations.

Users can switch between tabs (Active / Completed / Failed) with smooth animated transitions.
